    <h3>Theresa May rules out participating in TV debates before election</h3>
    <p>Theresa May has ruled out taking part in TV debates during the general election campaign, raising the possibility that broadcasters could host debates without the prime minister.</p>
    <p>â€œOur answer is no,â€ a No 10 source told the Guardian when asked about whether the prime minister would join any TV debates before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/theresa-may-uk-general-election-8-june">8 June election</a>.</p>
    <p>A Conservative party spokesman said there was no need for the public to see May face off against Jeremy Corbyn. â€œThe choice at this election is already clear: strong and stable leadership in the national interest with Theresa May and the Conservatives, or weak and unstable coalition government led by Jeremy Corbyn,â€ the spokesman said.</p>

    <p>TV debates involving the three main party leaders took place on the BBC, Sky News and ITV before the 2010 general election. In 2015, after protracted negotiations, David Cameron agreed to take part in only one live TV debate , which included six other leaders â€“ those of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip, the Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru.</p>
    <p> That was the only time Cameron debated face-to-face with Labourâ€™s Ed Miliband , but he also took part in an interview and audience Q&amp;A on Sky News, as well as a Question Time event on the BBC . During their debate, Miliband repeatedly accused the then prime minister of running scared .</p>

    <p>In response to Mayâ€™s refusal, Corbyn said: â€œElections and democracy are about public debate. So itâ€™s rather strange that only a couple of hours after calling for a general election, the prime minister is saying sheâ€™s not going to take part in TV debates.</p>
    <p>â€œWell, I say to Theresa May, who said this election was about leadership, come on and show some. Letâ€™s have the debates. Itâ€™s what democracy needs and the British people deserve.â€
    </p>
    <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said voters would expect to see TV debates and suggested broadcasters should go ahead without May.</p>
    <p>â€œThe prime ministerâ€™s attempt to dodge scrutiny shows how she holds the public in contempt,â€ Farron said. â€œI expect the broadcasters to do the right thing ; donâ€™t let the Conservatives call the shots. If the prime minister wonâ€™t attend, empty chair her. Corbyn can defend her position as they seem to vote the same on these matters. You have a moral duty to hold these debates.â€</p>
    <p>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotlandâ€™s first minister, who won plaudits for her TV debate performances during the 2015 election campaign, insisted broadcasters should press ahead with election debates without Theresa May.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, ITVâ€™s The Nightly Show became a casualty of Mayâ€™s decision to call a snap election as the broadcaster moved it back for an hour-long News at Ten.</p>
    <p>ITVâ€™s attempt at a late night chatshow has largely been a disappointment, failing to deliver the audiences that were hoped for. On Easter Monday the show â€“ hosted this week by Dermot Oâ€™Leary for a second time â€“ attracted an average audience of 2.2 million, or 12.6% of all viewers. </p>
    <p>During the ITV showâ€™s eight-week run, the news on BBC1 has achieved far higher than its average audience this year of 4.2 million. Last week it had ratings of 4.9 million on Monday and 5.1 million on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>An ITV spokesperson said: â€œIn light of todayâ€™s news we have made an amendment to the schedule for the evening and we have an extended News at Ten at 10pm and The Nightly Show at 11pm.â€</p>
    <p>This is the second time the show has been pushed back for an important news story: the first was the Westminster bridge attack.</p>
    <p>Separately, the BBC said its election coverage would be led by Huw Edwards, who is taking over from David Dimbleby.</p>"
